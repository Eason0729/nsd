[![Quality Gate Status](https://sonarcloud.io/api/project_badges/measure?project=Eason0729_nsd&metric=alert_status)](https://sonarcloud.io/summary/new_code?id=Eason0729_nsd)

## root file summary

- deps.ts dependencies for cache

## dictionary summary

- db
  - litesql file
  - litesql tool(included gitignore)
  - `db.ts`
- db/models
  - database model

## variable naming

- sanitize delete unnecessary data to avoid sending something confidential to
  user
- cleanValue value which has no possibility to inject the database

## setup

1. download nginx and use the `nginx.conf` in the root folder
2. launch nginx and deno@v1.13.2
3. ready to go(although I am too lazy to update the api file, which is too stale
   now)

## more

if you like docker, here is an Dockerfile.

if you want a muti machine application, you can :

1. edit`.env`file

```
ENVIRONMENT=development
PORT=3000
# make sure it's in network disk for muti machine
STORAGE_PATH=db/tmp/
# postgresql if muti machine
SQL_TYPE=sqlite
# make sure not NULL for postgresql
SQL_DATABASE=NULL
SQL_HOST=NULL
SQL_USERNAME=NULL
SQL_PASSWORD=NULL
SQL_PORT=NULL
# change password
DEFAULT_NAME=admin
DEFAULT_PASSWORD=password
TOKEN_TTL=7200000
HASH_TABLE=Xyju4NsGxfrJC6knwgP1i0W7vTB2R3KHocOpadZYmQqFIVltUEDLSzMh8e5Ab
```

Disclaimer: I didn't test it because docker get bad compatibility on `arm64`
